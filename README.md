# THE WORLD ADMIN

## Codespaces for the World, the Galaxy, the Universe, the Metaverse, the Multiverse, the Omniverse and every other mixture out there
### Let's do Good...Simply because we can!

This Repository started off as a collection of random things I looked at and said, "Oooooooooo That would be cool" and just clicked the fork button, having no idea what fork button really even did. Fast forward a year later and.....I'm still clicking the fork button and saying, "Oooooooooo That would be cool" except I know what a fork does, I can curl, merge, deploy a bot, make an environment with little secrets hidden in it, and so on. My point being, if you're new to this whole thing, don't worry....if you break it, just post an issue and someone is bound to help you eventually :). If you're a Veteran to this whole thing, STOP WRITING INSTRUCTIONS THAT DO NOT CLEARLY SAY WHAT TO DO NEXT. PLEASEEEEEE ALSO WRITE IN VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE WITH WORDS THAT DO NOT SOUND LIKE I NEED TO CURL MY HAIR WHY IM DRIVING TO GO SEE J5 AT THE WORLD REPOSITORY. That's all. :)

Have fun exploring. I am not making any recommendations as each person has a different reason why they are here and how they got here. Try it all. I just ask that when forking with my stuff, use it for to help you, your friends, your family, or just some random people who need a little luck and good vibes to come their way. Be well.
